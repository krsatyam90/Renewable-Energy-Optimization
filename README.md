## Introduction

The transition to renewable energy sources is imperative to combat climate change and achieve sustainability. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable energy accounted for nearly 30% of global electricity generation in 2022, highlighting its growing significance. For instance, advances in solar panel efficiency and wind turbine technology have already led to significant cost reductions and higher energy yields, making clean energy more accessible and impactful. This project leverages machine learning to optimize renewable energy production, storage, and distribution. By focusing on solar and wind energy, it enhances grid reliability, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and supports the global shift toward clean energy.
